CodeigniterVender
=================

This is for ruby fans who also love php. I love CodeIgniter, a php framework.

http://codeigniter.com/

The current CodeIgniter version is 1.7.2

Example
=======

ruby script/generate ci_app

ruby script/generate ci_controller blog hot old

How to start?
=============

First of all, you should have a ruby on rails environment.

Then create a rails project: rails -d mysql blog

After installed CodeigniterVender plugin, you can execute ruby script/generate ci_app in your RAILS_ROOT path
this will give you a total Codeigniter context.
Then use command like this (ruby script/generate ci_controller blog hot old) to generate Codeigniter controller and views.

Enjoy it!



TODO List
=================

* make the CodeigniterVender to a gem.
* more code generator for Codeigniter development.
* test!!!
