CodeigniterVender
=================

This is for ruby fans who also love php. I love CodeIgniter, a php framework.
It is a set of php-code generators.

http://codeigniter.com/

The current CodeIgniter version is 1.7.2

Example
=======
in your rails application:
ruby script/generate ci_app

ruby script/generate ci_controller blog hot old
 
The above commands will generate php code into public directory

How to start?
=============

First of all, you should have a ruby on rails environment.

Then create a rails project: rails -d mysql blog

After installed CodeigniterVender gem, you can execute ruby script/generate ci_app in your RAILS_ROOT path
this will give you a total Codeigniter context in RAILS_ROOT/public.
Then use command like this (ruby script/generate ci_controller blog hot old) to generate Codeigniter controller and views.

Enjoy it!



TODO List
=================

* more code generators for Codeigniter development.
* test!!!
